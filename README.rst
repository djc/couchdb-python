A Python library for working with CouchDB. `Downloads`_ are available via `PyPI`_.
Our `documentation`_ is also hosted there. We have a `mailing list`_.

This package currently encompasses four primary modules:

* ``couchdb.client``: the basic client library
* ``couchdb.design``: management of design documents
* ``couchdb.mapping``: a higher-level API for mapping between CouchDB documents and Python objects
* ``couchdb.view``: a CouchDB view server that allows writing view functions in Python

It also provides a couple of command-line tools:

* ``couchdb-dump``: writes a snapshot of a CouchDB database (including documents, attachments, and design documents) to MIME multipart file
* ``couchdb-load``: reads a MIME multipart file as generated by couchdb-dump and loads all the documents, attachments, and design documents into a CouchDB database
* ``couchdb-replicate``: can be used as an update-notification script to trigger replication between databases when data is changed

Prerequisites:

* Python 2.7, 3.4 or later
* CouchDB 0.10.x or later (0.9.x should probably work, as well)

``simplejson`` will be used if installed.
