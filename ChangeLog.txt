Version 0.5
http://couchdb-python.googlecode.com/svn/tags/0.5.0
(Nov 28, 2008, from branches/0.5.x)

 * `schema.Document` objects can now be used in the documents list passed to
   `client.Database.update()`.
 * `Server.__contains__()` and `Database.__contains__()` now use the HTTP HEAD
   method to avoid unnecessary transmission of data. `Database.__del__()` also
   uses HEAD to determine the latest revision of the document.
 * The `Database` class now has a method `delete()` that takes a document
   dictionary as parameter. This method should be used in preference to
   `__del__` as it allow conflict detection and handling.
 * Added `cache` and `timeout` arguments to the `client.Server` initializer.
 * The `Database` class now provides methods for deleting, retrieving, and
   updating attachments.
 * The Python view server now exposes a `log()` function to map and reduce
   functions (issue 21).
 * Handling of the rereduce stage in the Python view server has been fixed.
 * The `Server` and `Database` classes now implement the `__nonzero__` hook
   so that they produce sensible results in boolean conditions.
 * The client module will now reattempt a request that failed with a
   "connection reset by peer" error.
 * inf/nan values now raise a `ValueError` on the client side instead of
   triggering an internal server error (issue 31).
 * Added a new `couchdb.design` module that provides functionality for
   managing views in design documents, so that they can be defined in the
   Python application code, and the design documents actually stored in the
   database can be kept in sync with the definitions in the code.
 * The `include_docs` option for CouchDB views is now supported by the new
   `doc` property of row instances in view results. Thanks to Paul Davis for
   the patch (issue 33).
 * The `keys` option for views is now supported (issue 35).


Version 0.4
http://couchdb-python.googlecode.com/svn/tags/0.4.0
(Jun 28, 2008, from branches/0.4.x)

 * Updated for compatibility with CouchDB 0.8.0
 * Added command-line scripts for importing/exporting databases.
 * The `Database.update()` function will now actually perform the `POST`
   request even when you do not iterate over the results (issue 5).
 * The `_view` prefix can now be omitted when specifying view names.


Version 0.3
http://couchdb-python.googlecode.com/svn/tags/0.3.0
(Feb 6, 2008, from branches/0.3.x)

 * The `schema.Document` class now has a `view()` method that can be used to
   execute a CouchDB view and map the result rows back to objects of that
   schema.
 * The test suite now uses the new default port of CouchDB, 5984.
 * Views now return proxy objects to which you can apply slice syntax for
   "key", "startkey", and "endkey" filtering.
 * Add a `query()` classmethod to the `Document` class.


Version 0.2
http://couchdb-python.googlecode.com/svn/tags/0.2.0
(Nov 21, 2007, from branches/0.2.x)

 * Added __len__ and __iter__ to the `schema.Schema` class to iterate
   over and get the number of items in a document or compound field.
 * The "version" property of client.Server now returns a plain string
   instead of a tuple of ints.
 * The client library now identifies itself with a meaningful
   User-Agent string.
 * `schema.Document.store()` now returns the document object instance,
   instead of just the document ID.
 * The string representation of `schema.Document` objects is now more
   comprehensive.
 * Only the view parameters "key", "startkey", and "endkey" are JSON
   encoded, anything else is left alone.
 * Slashes in document IDs are now URL-quoted until CouchDB supports
   them.
 * Allow the content-type to be passed for temp views via
   `client.Database.query()` so that view languages other than
   Javascript can be used.
 * Added `client.Database.update()` method to bulk insert/update
   documents in a database.
 * The view-server script wrapper has been renamed to `couchpy`.
 * `couchpy` now supports `--help` and `--version` options.
 * Updated for compatibility with CouchDB release 0.7.0.


Version 0.1
http://couchdb-python.googlecode.com/svn/tags/0.1.0
